# Portfolio Landing Page

## Description

This repository houses the landing page for my portfolio. The work shown on this page reflects both my capability as well as what I bring to the table. It's also some of the designs I am most proud of. While constructing this, I was able to reinforce the fundamentals of HTML/CSS and incorporate the use of JavaScript.
